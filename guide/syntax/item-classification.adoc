.UBL example of UNSPSC
[source, xml, indent=0]
----
include::{snippet-dir}/item.xml[tags=unspsc]
----
<1> listID must be from UNCL7143 code list, and code TST indicates this is a UNSPSC classification, listVersionID is optional, but can be used to specify the version of UNSPSC. NOTE, in previous versions code MP was used as a temporary workaround to identify UNSPSC. In release 3.0.5 in fall 2020 it is replaced with the new 7143 code TST that is specific for UNSPSC.
