= Calculation of GST

One GST Breakdown shall be provided for each distinct combination of GST category code and GST rate found in either the line GST information or the Document level allowance or charges.

For each distinct combination of GST category code and GST rate the calculations are:
====
stem:["GST category taxable amount (BT-116-GST)" = sum("Invoice line net amounts (BT-113)")]
stem:[+ "Document level charge amount (BT-99)" - "Document level allowance amount (BT-93)"]
====

====
stem:["GST category tax amount (BT-117-GST)" ]
stem:[= "GST category taxable amount (BT-116-GST)" times ("GST rate (BT-119-GST)" div 100)]
====

IMPORTANT: For GST Breakdown where the GST Category is "Not subject to GST" (O), the GST category tax amount shall be zero.
